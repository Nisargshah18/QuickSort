Steps to run the Algorithm: 

1) The program prompts the user to enter any 10 random integers. 
2) Enter any random 10 integers one by one. 
3) As soon as the limit for the integer reaches, the algorithm will print the array before it was sorted. 
4) After the array "before sorted" is printed out, algorithm will print out the array after it has sorted all the random 10 integers one by one.
